# Description
Welcome! This is a project that I made for my Systems Analysis and Modeling course (AMS @IST) class in the year academic year 2023/2024.

It had two deliveries, with instructions for both in the Statement.pdf. They both use the same Universe-of-Discourse (UoD), that presents the 
set of entities, concepts and relationships relevant to the project's domain.

Both deliveries are better explained in their corresponding folder.

## Technologies

- For the first delivery, we used [ArchiMate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate) and [BPMN](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation)

- For the second delivery, we used [Enterprise Architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Architect_(software))
